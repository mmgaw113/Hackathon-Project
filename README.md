## The Project
Using the ArcGIS Maps SDK for Unity, our team set out to make a Virtual Reality Biking Simulator, VBS 1.0, that allows the user to experience biking outdoors, while staying in the comfort of your own home.</br>
Our team set out to gather real world biking data that allows the user to pick where they would like to bike. These data sets consist of common biking paths/trails, elevation, and distance. By collecting this data, we can then create Feature Layers that allow the user to select which path they will want to bike through.</br>
